# easyRETS
RETS for the masses

So the idea behind easyRETS is to build a full-on Wordpress plugin using all the knowledge I've garnered over the 11 years of RETS development I've done.  I really need to keep working thru this project and actually build out the product, but it's rather hard because I am currently homeless and don't even have access to a laptop computer (I am typing this on a library computer that I thankfully have access to for 2 hours everyday)

A big part of the project that is missing I think is the creation of the primary RETS property table that needs to be present before the code can be run sucessfully.  I don't think I currently include the SQL file that I use to build the "master_rets_table" that this system currently is looking for...

If there is any demand for me to flesh out this system, I will attend to it...thanks!
