# easyRETS
RETS for the masses

So the idea behind easyRETS is to build a full-on Wordpress plugin using all the knowledge I've garnered over the 11 years of RETS development I've done.  I really need to keep working thru this project and actually build out the product, but it's rather hard because I am currently homeless and don't even have access to a laptop computer (I am typing this on a library computer that I thankfully have access to for 2 hours everyday)

A big part of the project that is missing I think is the creation of the primary RETS property table that needs to be present before the code can be run sucessfully.  I don't think I currently include the SQL file that I use to build the "master_rets_table" that this system currently is looking for...

DON'T LET THE HAPHAZARD LOOK OF THIS CODEBASE FOOL YOU!  This is actually a VERY powerful backend RETS download system that will work, once understood, to quickly update a local database table with all current MLS properties available FOR SALE in your local area RETS system, and also will download all the MLS images to your local server as well.  As we all know, good SEO requires you to have the database and the images stored locally and "hotlinking" don't really work all that well for SEO.

If you spend some time reading the various code comments and try to run the code, you will eventually be rewarded with a working backend RETS property and image downloading system.  All the hard working of dynamically creating tables and creating the "chunk-back" time slicing (as to not overload the remote RETS servers) is done and is fully debugged and working.

If there is any demand for me to flesh out this system, I will attend to it...thanks!
